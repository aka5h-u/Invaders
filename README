This a game recreating the Invaders game in 512 bytes, that can be
run as a COM file or put into a boot sector of a floppy disk to be
run.

Move with keyboard arrows to left and right, press Space to shoot.

As it uses the PUSHA/POPA instructions it only works in 80286 and
higher. The source code has the option to assemble for 8088 with
usage of some extra bytes. (530 bytes total in my last count) 

A small video of the game running over emulation:

If you want to assemble it, you must download the Netwide Assembler
(nasm) from www.nasm.us

Use this command line:

  nasm -f bin invaders.asm -Dcom_file=1 -o invaders.com
  nasm -f bin invaders.asm -Dcom_file=0 -o invaders.img

Tested with VirtualBox for Mac OS X running Windows XP running this
game, it also works with DosBox and probably with qemu:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -fda invaders.img

Enjoy it!
